Key/value stores play a significant role in modern distributed systems.  They  * allow a program to easily store data to a high-availability server, and to  * easily retrieve that data.  A key/value store may be persistent, or it may be  * an in-memory cache.  Key/value stores are usually replicated and distributed,  * but we won't worry about those features for this assignment.  Examples of   * key/value stores include Redis, MongoDB, Memcached, DynamoDB, Firebase,   * CouchBase, Voldemort, and many more.  Since key/value stores do not track   * many-one relationships among elements, they are sometimes called "NoSQL"  * databases.
